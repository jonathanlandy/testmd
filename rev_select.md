# `RevSelect` 

A class for carrying out reverse, single-step linear feature selection
protocols.  At each step, the feature that is selected is that which reduces
the total COD (coefficient of determination, aka R^2) by the least amount.  The
feature ordering and CODs are stored, allowing for review.

## Special Attributes
#### `ordered_feature_list: list`
  List of the feature indices.  The ordering is the reverse of that in which the
  features were removed from the predictor set during selection.

#### `cod_list: list`
  This list's index `i` specifies the COD that results if only the first `i`
  features of `ordered_feature_list` are taken as predictors (large COD values are
  better and a perfect score = `n_targets`).

## Methods
#### `__init__(self, dtype=np.float32)`
    
*Parameters*

  * `dtype`: numeric variable type

    Computations will be carried out using this level of precision. Note: Lower
    precision types result in faster computation. However, for nearly redundant
    data sets these can sometimes result in `nan` results populating the
    `cod_list`.

#### `fit(self, X, y)`
Method fits passed data, evaluates `self.ordered_feature_list` and
`self.cod_list`.
    
*Parameters*

 * `X : np.array (n_examples, n_features)`
 
   Data array of features containing samples across all features.  Must be
   numeric.
 
 * `y : np.array (n_examples, n_labels)`, default `None`
 
   Array of label values for each example. If `n_labels > 1` we seek
   the features that maximize the sum total COD over the separate
   labels.  If `None` passed, we carry out unsupervised selection,
   treating all features as targets.  If passed, must be numeric.
 
*Returns*

 * `self` : fitted instance

## Supervised example
The code below carries out a reverse stepwise selection procedure on a
supervised example:  We construct a random `X` array and then define a `y`
array that is a specified linear combination of the columns of `X`. Passing
these to a `RevSelect` instance's `fit` method, the `ordered_feature_list` and
cod_list` are then evaluated and stored.

```python
import numpy as np
from linselect import RevSelect

# Generate a random data set
M = 1000    # example count
N = 4       # feature count
X = np.random.rand(M, N)
y = np.dot(X, np.arange(N).reshape([-1, 1])) 

# Carry out forward selection
selector = RevSelect()
selector.fit(X, y)

# Get the ordered features and COD lists
print selector.ordered_feature_list
# [3, 2, 1, 0] 

print selector.cod_list
# [0.625, 0.923, 0.999, 1.000]
```

## Unsupervised example
The code below carries out a forward stepwise selection procedure on an
unsupervised example:  We construct a random `X` array and then pass this to a
`RevSelect` instance's `fit` method, the `ordered_feature_list` and `cod_list`
are then evaluated and stored.  Note that to generate this example, we use
numpy's `multivariate_normal` sampler, after first generating a random,
non-negative definite covariance matrix.  Apparently, the second feature in
this sample was able to account for about 3.63 / 4.00 of the full variance
exhibited in the data set.

```python
import numpy as np
from linselect import RevSelect

# Constants
M = 100    # example count
N = 4      # feature count

# Generate a random, correlated data set
c = np.random.rand(N, N)
C = np.dot(c.T, c)
X = np.random.multivariate_normal(np.zeros(N), C, M)

# Carry out forward selection
selector = RevSelect()
selector.fit(X)

# Get the ordered features and COD lists
print selector.ordered_feature_list
# [2, 0, 3, 1] 

print selector.cod_list
# [3.63, 3.91, 3.97, 4.00] 
```
